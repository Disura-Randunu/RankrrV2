Let me explain.<br /><br />I work with lots of women.  Thousands of them.  Some would say I have a position of authority.  Mix in my general awesomeness, and one would say it is a recipe for a sexual harassment suit.  Unfortunately, that's exactly what happened.  It was only a matter of time.  I knew I was innnocent, and I'm sure at this point you, the reader are assuming innocence on my part as well.  After all...innocent until proven guilty, no?<br /><br />It can be said that a man who acts as his own lawyer has a fool for a client.  I was that fool.  At the trial, I was asked to make an opening statement for the defense of my foolish client, to which I responded, \\""I only have one thing to say in defense of my client, and that is in order for there to be a sexual harassment suit in the workplace, two things must be present.  One, the accused must have a position of authority, to which there is no argument.  My client has a position of authority.  B, in order to qualify as sexual harassment, the actions performed by the accused toward the victim must be unwelcome.  To show that there is no way that any such actions could be perceived as unwelcome, I enter into evidence, Exhibit A.\\""<br /><br />Immediately upon finishing my opening argument, I pressed play on the tape deck of the boom box I brought with me.  The sweet strains of \\""Slow Ride\\"" by Foghat blared throughout the courtroom.  I then flipped my mullet out from the back of my gray Members Only jacket where it was hidden and unzipped the front of it to reveal the Three Wolf Moon Short Sleeve Tee.  Before I could reach down to retrieve my sweet mirrored shades to complete my look, chaos erupted throughout the court.  Six female and one male member of the jury immediately began trying to fight their way past one another to be the first to climb over the railing and prostrate themselves at my feet.  While the male bailiff was trying his best to restrain the jurors within their box,there was no one to stop the female court stenographer.  She took the pins out of her hair as she moved toward me, letting her auburn locks fall about her shoulders.  Half way to me, her breathing was so heavy that she popped the top button on her blouse as her wanton bosom strained to break free of the conservative suit she had chosen for the day.<br /><br />The judge pounded his gavel, shouting for order in the court...but there was none to be found.  He knew that we were mere seconds away from a sexual attack in which my client (still me) was suddenly shifted from the accused to a victim-in-waiting.  Unfortunately for any voyeurs attending the trial, nothing really happened and the courtroom became quite boring after that.  The judge dismissed the trial on the count of overwhelming evidence against any sexual advancement on my part being unwelcome.  I zipped back up my jacket, covering up the Three Wolf Moon Short Sleeve Tee, and turned off my tunes. Before the stenographer could be escorted from the premises, she did manage to remove her panties and throw them to me.  Luckily for her, she remembered that she always wrote her name and phone number on her panties like her mother told her to do as a child, but that is another story.",2013-04-26

Wooo!\\"" He devoured me with his wide, blood-red eyes, and I knew that it was the t-shirt that made him so attractive. The three wolves on the shirt must have imprinted on him making him just as hungry and intesne as the wolves themselves.

This shirt made my biceps so large that I needed to order a sleeveless one just so I wouldn't look ridiculous. (See my review for the sleeveless version for the 5 star rating). To make a long story short....After some investigation, I realized that this design is identical to the one that I got for my 7th birthday in 1988. A quick phone call to my mother confirmed that the original was purchased at Zayre's in Assinippi, MA  and I am sure that the shirt for sale here is from the same lot number. Believing that to be true, I wanted to re-live that special day in 1988 when I laced up my British Knights and hopped into the backseat of our Oldsmobile Firenza to embark on the 3 mile trip to Chuck-E-Cheese for my birthday extravaganza. That year, I had originally asked for a Micro-Machines City play set as well as a green Koosh Ball as I already had the blue one, but I got this shirt instead. What I DID NOT ask for for my birthday that year was the extraordinary power and responsibility that this shirt would bring me as a 7 year old. Once I took possession of the shirt, I could immediately solve a Rubik's cube without removing the stickers, successfully transform my G1 Ultra Magnus back into his &#34;vehicle&#34; form, and actually complete level 3 on Double Dragon III for NES. If you're a fan of the &#34;Double Dragon&#34; games, you should know that the third game of the trilogy is undeniably the hardest. Not only is it the hardest of the &#34;Double Dragon&#34; trilogy, but it's also one of the hardest games ever to be released on the NES. Enemies keep ganging up on you, it's hard to pull off some of the moves, your energy drains faster in this game, and on top of all that, you only have one life in this entire game. Playing in 2-Player mode is your only chance of survival. Along the way, you get new players added onto your team, but they have different skills and are somewhat useless. The only thing I find entertaining about this game is that the dialogue has tons of typos. In conclusion, if you own this game and still have a lot of trouble beating it, I could give you some advice: Buy The Mountain Three Wolf Moon Short Sleeve Tee.",2014-12-30

A wolf came up to me sometime in January, and he tried to eat me. As the beast leapt for my huddled figure, I thrust forth my chest and the magical power of the 3 wolves tamed the beast and he bowed before me in submission. I ran with the wolves as my brothers, and lived as the Alpha-male of a pack of timber wolves in Northern Alberta. By the time I was found by civilized folk I had a beard that reached my waist and could no longer speak English, only a guttural wolf language.

But magically one afternoon while combing the park, I happened across a raccoon that was so intimidated by the my Three Wolf Moon Shirt that it ran cowering in fear into a gopher hole.  I followed it for many leagues only to encounter a woodland shaman, where the magic happened.  The shaman proceeded to force me to smoke payote for 40 days and 40 nights with him.  After this long ordeal I was enlightened and after leaving the shaman gopher lair I was blessed with the powers described in previous reviews.       So the very next day I went to Popeye's Chicken where the women serving happened to be Oprah!  She took my order with a wink and smile and on my receipt I found a mysterious # with an area code unknown to me.  For many days I smoked more payote and contemplated calling the number.  \\""Could this be Oprah's number,\\"" I thought.  \\""The only way I will know is if I call it.\\""  So I signed up for Comcast Triple Play so that I would receive the clearest reception possible and followed up with a call.  I got a busy signal, so I waited it out.  Somehow magically I got through.     But the person who answered wasn't Oprah but introduced himself as Kimbo Slice!  Kimbo offered me 10000$ if I could handle a punch in the stomach from him, and he told me that this was the only way that I could see Oprah.  So we agreed to meet in the shady garage of his rap producer, Dr. Dre, at his secret mansion in Alaska.  So I went on an epic journey hitch hiking my way on semi's like it was the show Iceroad Truckers on the History Channel.  After many near death experiences I had finally arrived.     Upon arrival at the gate a bag was thrown over my head and I buldgeoned unconcious.  When I woke up I was in a shady garage with Kimbo Slice in front of me.  He started charging toward me with his fist pulled back so I thought of the words of the shaman and prepared myself for the blow.  I closed my eyes and the next thing I heard was Kimbo Slice yelling in agony.  I opened my eyes to see Kimbo's arm missing a hand.  I looked at my shirt and saw that there was blood only on the mouths of the wolves.  It appeared that the Wolves had ate Kimbo's hand.  The shirt had saved my life.       I ran out of the garage and into Oprah's arms spread wide.  She gave me a big hug and a pat on the back for a job well done.  She had been captured by Kimbo and forced to work at Popeye's, and was thankful that I had rescued her.  I told her about the shirt and after giving me a million million dollars she said \\""I will buy this shirt instead of shoes for all the children in Africa that I donate to.  This shirt will save them from being abducted and raped and murdered.\\""       There are many other stories I could tell about this shirt but the review says to make it short, but detailed so I figured that this tale would suffice.

I assumed my best match search result would be an obscure album by a hit music group, but I was much, much more fortunate that day.

As I sat at the booth dining I felt a presence as if someone was standing over me.  I looked up to find a powerful, solemn Native Indian gentleman looking down at me with piercing eyes-- at once calming and fiercely strong.  He asked my name.  I told him, shaking, as he responded simply, resolutely that he was The Mountain.  Yes, the designer of my shirt The Mountain.  He had also stopped into our local Chipotle for a quick bite that afternoon.<br /><br />He sat down with me and began to talk.  I had so many questions.  To be honest, I can't remember most of the conversation although I sat,  transfixed in dialogue for hours.  He told me that his design stemmed from an ancient tale involving three mythical young warriors and their dramatic transformation into Wolves during times of great anger.  I believe he said the tale was simply known in Native communities as Teen Wolf.

So I ordered the shirt in size XXXL so it'd be a little tight to show off my breastes... and since Billy Bo done run out on me for that hussy bobbi jo, I need to find me another good boy, cause the babies need a daddy and Billy Bo don't pay no support since he got fired from the Arby's.     So I get the shirt in the mail, and immediately cut the sleeves into strips and the bottom too, 'cause that makes it hot, and you can still see the wolves and all. I also cut a V in the shirt as to better show off the goods(y'all know what I mean).     I soon discovered that it's ALL true y'all! Fer real! As soon as I squeezed myself out the trailer (I swear that dang door has gotten smaller since I had the triplets). As soon as soon as I walked out the door, John Thomas(J.T. fer short) walked out his trailer, like a dog in heat..he sauntered over, and now he and I are expectin' TWINS! And we got a double wide, cause I can't fit through the door no more...but it's good cause J.T.'s got a real good job at the Waffle House.

Earlier this week, I bought this shirt just to see what all the fuss was about, and have found it superior to any former T-shirts with powers I have purchased. It has helped me in every way imaginable. For example, I wore it to a Dungeons and Dragons game against my mother and Bobby, my friend in the third grade, and I dominated the game immediately. I have also recently been followed by multiple young elven girls on my \\""World of Warcraft\\"" campaign. The only ultimate downside of it is that it barely reaches the end of my chest.

I was 23 then.  I didn't think about the shirt much but I wore it 'cuz I liked it.  I was workin at Mary Jane's Unicorn Cafe (like I am now) and I was single.  agin.  I just got back with Shanna for about the 100th time and then she was mad cuz she cant call me.  I told her I didn't have no minutes on my cell, but she was mad and dumped me... Again.  She wint back with that guy- Jeff (Weedhopper)- again.  I think she got knocked up with him now.  But after mamaw gave me the shirt, I met Misty Dawn. we just kinda got on when we met.  She was seein that guy Scruggs and went to claiborne county so I didnt know here- she says I saw her at a football game, but I don't rmeember.  But later I saw her again and she was cryin.  She found out Scruggs was cheatin on her (I could tell her that!).  But we started talkin and then I called her and I would use up all my minutes talkin and textin her.  She started coming to my church sometimes, and everyone thought she was great.  Then one night after wednesday church my preacher and my uncle were talkin with me and having a cigarette and preacher Hatmaker said, \\""Son.. I reckon you better start looking to marry that pretty thing you been bringin' to church.\\""  Man!  It was like a thunderbot hit me or somethin.  I didn't even think of it before!  And then it was funny... I went around side the church and tried to call Misty Dawn but I didn't have any minutes!  I ran back in and got Aunt Lou's phone (she's always got minutes) and called Misty dawn.  Two months later she made me the happiest guy around.  We had the wetting at her Aunt Twila and unlce Scooters house cuz she wanted to come down stairs in her wedding dress and twila and Scooter have those pulldown ones for the attic.  I was soooo nervous!  But here we are!  I'm still workin at the Unicorn and Misty Dawn got a job at the Pilot.  We can even walk and hang out when we have our break.<br /><br />I never thought about the shirt until I saw this here.  I believe the Lord brought this shirt in my life.  It seems like all the best times I had with Misty Dawn I was wearin this shirt.  Mine is startin to wear out.  I got oil splashed on in from teh fryer one day and it got some small holes and stains.  And it's got a little hole on the shoulder.  But I still love it.  Last week we were out to see Misty Dawn's uncle EG up at Brushy mountain.  His wife was there at the same time (visiting hours arent too good).  She brought her new young-un, Shawn and her daugher Rhianna.  Rhianna just kept starin at me and the wolves on the shirt!  She kept pickiin at hte picture like she was playin a video game or something... She was totally zoned!  When we left she gave me the biggest hug and started to cry wehn we left. I think it was the shirt! ;o)  Even my mamaw says somthin nice about how I look when I wear this shirt.  She never tells me she likes what i wear!<br /><br />But anyway, I'm just goin on...

I am a 25-26 inch waist I weight 125-129 and I'm 5'6&#34; 1/2 so I usually just go with 5'7&#34;. I purchased the small and I felt like it could be a little tighter because the first day I got it I could hook it on the second row. I think I would like it a lot better if it was a bit shorter because I really couldn't sit with it at all. I was sitting up as straight and tall as I possibly can but it was sooo uncomfortable it basically digged in my butt and bended in weird places. I wanted to return it because I wanted something I could wear to work and since I can't wear this one I feel like I'm never going to wear it, but I didn't feel like paying the shipping to send it back. I would say for everyone else you should still try it for your self because my issues may not be a problem for you. For me I would give it two stars but I gave it three because it is sturdy and seems like a quality product. And even tho I wanted it to be tighter it still made my waist and stomach seem smaller.<br /><br />By the way I didn't really get it to look smaller I got it hoping that it would keep my stomach small while I try to gain weight. (Like the way a cast makes your arm smaller)  Lol I'm trying to get to hour glass status. But every time I try to gain weight my weight is so evenly distributed that if I get 1 inch of butt I also get 1 inch of stomach. :-/",2014-09-29

I have that dreaded pooch/flap thing going on along with a C-section scar that is still really pronounced and tons of glaring stretch marks. 2- I am tall. At 5'10&#34;, 1 piece suits give me the dreaded camel toe and are just plain uncomfortable. 3- I'm 29. I'm not ready for a &#34;mom&#34; bathing suit (although, being a mom now, I suppose anything I wear will be a mom suit. I digress....) 4- I don't live near a beach. I don't own a pool. I didn't want to blow a car payment on a suit to be worn 2 or 3 times.  Results: Whoever designed this suit should win some sort of humanitarian award for their efforts here! This suit is slimming, even sucking in my mom pooch without looking like it is straining to do so. The bottoms come to about 2 inches below my top, but also look cute scrunched down just to my waistline. AND MY WHOLE BUM IS COVERED EVEN WHEN THE SUIT IS FULLY EXTENDED. It is on the vintage trend and looks stylish. My one (minor) complaint is one that I have had with every halter suit I have ever tried on and even the majority of bras: the top gives me the 4-boob look when I lean forward and then back. I sew, so it was a very easy fix to make the cups closer and this should not be an issue for the vast majority of ladies out there.  Sizing; I am currently wearing a size 14 pants and 38 C/D bra. I opted for the XXXL. I probably could've gotten away with the XXL, but I am happy with my decision.  All-in-all, if I ever met the designer of this suit, I would get on the ground and kiss their feet for making a suit that will make me feel comfortable enough to actually enjoy my time at the pool with my daughter on my upcoming vacation!",2015-07-03

The XXL cuts into my legs a little bit but feels stretchy and like it will be fine. The spacing problem on the top is a real thing, and I need to get a friend to stitch it closer together for me... or use a safety pin, which unfortunately is how lazy I am.<br /><br />The ripping seams sound happened, but it is clear that was just a packaging sound. There was no weird smell at all.<br /><br />Overall, and especially for the price, I am so happy with this. I ultimately kept both of the suits because they fit well in different ways.

The bottoms fit me pretty well, so I don't want to risk returning the suit for a smaller size just to fit on top, but not on bottom. I wish the tie in the front was actually adjustable.

I will buy this sport type again but it will be a size 36 when I do. I put on so much weight in the past 2 years going from a size 6 to a size 14 which also caused my hernia (from lifting heavy pallets at work) to bulge out so much that it hurt, I also gained what everyone talks about the famous  \\""muffin top\\"" how I hate it, it just totally changed my shape to looking deformed. Yes I am trying to lose weight but it is a struggle especially since menopause kicked in and the hormones are so out of control but anyways this cincher is giving me a kick start, and it really helps hold everything in, especially my hernia, I love the support it gives. I actually look normal, this is no cure but it helps so much and I feel great and its only been 4 days wearing it for 8 to 12 hours.

I do agree that there is too much space in the top between the cups, but I found an easy solution. I untied the bow tie and twisted the cups several times, retied the bow and then put it on. I think about 4 times was perfect. I had to try it a couple different times before I found the right amount. I think I could have actually gone with a smaller size on the bottom but definitely not the top as the va-va room factor would have been a bit much. It's already pretty sexy.

This bathing suit covers exactly what I want it to cover while accentuating the boobage. For $20 bucks, you really can't go wrong. It feels like a real bathing suit to me, but even if it doesn't last long, who cares? It's disposable at this price!  The stitching on one of the cups is a bit off, but only for about an inch. Can't really tell. Have someone tie you in the top, if you can. Gives you a lot more support. The cups are a few layers thick, so you don't have to worry about nips showing through (I personally don't like that).

I had to order an XXXL and I usually wear an XL in shirts and a 14 in women's in pants. I had to sew the top closer together because I felt like my girls were going to fall out otherwise. The bottoms were great and I was able to situate them on my body where I wanted them to sit. The material is a little thin so I wouldn't expect to get years of use out of it but it will definitely last a summer so it's not to bad for the price.",2015-07-13

I thought it was super cute online.  I usually never shop online for clothing because I'm 5'1 and about 215 pounds.  I ordered the XXXL and it fits great.  I feel like someone who is anymore than 10-15 pounds more than me probably wouldn't fit in the bottoms though.  I wear a 38 C bra size and the cups on the swimming suit fit fine.  The space between the cups is pretty big, but I didn't feel like I couldn't wear it in public the way it is.  The quality of it feels nice, and I'm really looking forward to wearing this to the pool and the cabin this summer!",2014-06-07

Only the cup size though, as I am a 36DDD, so that is fairly typical. The bottom was actually a little big, I am a size 12, but that was expected as well. I ordered large to try and fit my bust. Overall for the price not bad, not spectacular. If you want a moderate use suit (and have a smaller bust) this is a really cute cheap suit.",2015-05-18

I bought the navy suit with red polka dots in XXXL (I'm 5'6 and 192lbs) and it mostly fit like a dream. I'm not very chesty so I ended up sewing up a bit of the top to give the illusion that I filled the suit out. Wearing this bathing suit was literally the first time I have ever felt comfortable, and actually liked how I looked, in a swimsuit. Highly recommend.",2014-07-22

And I'm not sure that helped much. But it still looks good. The cups are very flimsy, but it will be fine for a pool party. Becuase the material is very thin and the top is small and loose fitting, I don't think I'd trust this for a water park or beach. But its perfect for lounging by and floating in a pool.<br />The bottoms fit good; a little loose in the midsection, but not tight around the legs.<br />I'm 5' 5&#34;, size 12-14, and a 38DDD. This suit fit the size that was listed; even though the 3X sticker was a bit alarming. This was my favorite print of the three I ordered, but the blue/white large polka fit my body the best.",2015-06-22

I normally wear a US 14/16 and so I wanted to order the XXXXL which stated was a 14/16 but when I tried to select that option it said that size didn't ship to Colombia. I contacted Amazon and a wonderful customer service rep helped me look for options in my size. The choice that ships to Colombia is really poor and we didn't find anything. In the end I decided to give it a shot and order the XXXL 12/14. It arrived super fast in like 3 days and I was so happy it fit wonderfully! The bottoms were perfect, no struggle to get on the size is perfect for me. The top could be a little bigger because I'm a 40D but it doesn't look shameless hehe. This is the first bikini I have bought in my life because of my body shape I always felt embarrassed of the bulging belly. But after buying this I'm glad I took the risk and even ordered two the blue and red polka dot and the red black polka dot skull bottoms. I love them and I feel super confident about wearing them on the beautiful Caribbean beach this August. So any of you big ladies out there doubting... high waist bikinis are the bomb gals super flattering and super comfy. Material is great, and looks just like the pics!",2015-07-03

I'm a 12 but I wear a 38GGG bra. I thought if I bought the largest size I could take in the bottoms like I normally do and the top would fit me. Well, the top was poorly constructed. It had no support and my neck was killing me... big boob girl problems &#34;shrug&#34;  I had about four boobs. my boobs where pushing out on the sides and they were slipping underneath the suit. very frustrated because it is a cute suit overall. If you have a size 16 suit make the top huge to keep up with the sizing. the top portion would have only fit a C cup at most.",2015-05-18

The top is a bit wide in the cleavage, but I am going to alter it. I really like the suit,  I don't see it lasting years, but I think it will last at least 2 summers.
